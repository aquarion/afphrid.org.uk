Afphrid was a database of pretend relationships in the group Alt.fan.pratchett. It was the first PHP application I ever wrote.

Afphrid 2 was the rewrite. It was the third PHP application I ever wrote.

This code is between 18 and 15 years old. It doesn't work very well any more, it's fucking awful code, but it's kind of here as a reminder that everything starts from somewhere.

It requires PHP3 and MySQL 3.18. Yes, it's really that old.
